                <p>The architecture of a web application establishes how applications, middleware systems, and databases interact<br> 
                    in order to enable seamless collaboration between multiple applications. When a user enters a URL into the browser's address bar and presses "Go,"<br>
                    the browser will locate the Internet-connected server where the website is hosted and send a request for that specific page.</P> 

            <br>
                    <p>Following the request, the server promptly sends files to the browser. Once received,<br>
                        these files are executed by the browser in order to display the desired page for user access.<br> 
                        Consequently, users can then engage with and utilize various features of the website seamlessly<br>
                        within a few seconds timeframe otherwise websites would simply be disregarded by users.</P> 
                
            <br>
                <p>The code that has been parsed by the browser is crucial in this context. This<br>
                    particular code may or may not contain specific instructions for the browser on how to respond to various inputs.<br>
                    Consequently, web application architecture encompasses all sub-components and external interactions<br>
                    with other applications within a complete software application.</p>

            <br>
                <p>The design of web application architecture is essential as it ensures efficient functioning<br>
                    while effectively fulfilling its unique requirements and objectives. Considering that a significant portion of worldwide network traffic,<br> 
                    along with every application and device, relies on web-based communication, the importance cannot be underestimated.<br>
                    This framework encompasses scalability, efficiency, reliability, and security to ensure optimal performance.</p>
