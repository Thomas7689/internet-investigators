                The internet is a vast array of computers all over the world and to understand how it became so massive we must go back to when it all started in 1962 in the United Sates of America. <strong>J.C.R Licklider</strong> (top left image) came up with an idea that a network of computers could communicate with one another. In 1969 the first message was sent across a network called <strong>ARPANET</strong>, which was the governments computer network. At the end of 1969 there were only four computers connected to the network. In 1971 several other networks were made; these were known as LAN (Local Area Network). 
            </p>

            <p>In the same year (1971) <strong>Ray Tomlinson</strong> developed a system that would send mail to other computers on the network. This system used the “@” symbol in between the host’s name and the user’s name so they could be told apart. This system would eventually go on to be called electronic mail, or as it is referred to today “email”. 
                With all the technological advancements around the world and the many networks of computers that were developed needed a way to communicate with each other.

                With all the technological advancements around the world and the many networks of computers that were developed needed a way to communicate with each other. In 1973 Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed a set of protocols that would enable computers to communicate across the globe in a virtual space, this was called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP split in 1978 into two parts: TCP and IP (internet protocol) which formed the basis of the TCP/IP protocol.

                In 1991 was the year the World Wide Web was invented by a computer programmer named <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>(bottom right image). Tim made what was only used by scientists and governments accessible to everyone and in 1993 the world saw the first graphical user interface browser called Erwise. This led to the development of Mosaic which popularized “surfing” the web.
