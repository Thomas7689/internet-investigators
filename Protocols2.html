            <h2>Short and Sweat Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Internet protocols are a set of rules and regulations we need to follow. To ensure that the communication between humans and computers across the world in the same. We get different protocols that is used in the network to communicate with different devices. We have ten namely: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Post office Protocol (POP), Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Terminal Network (TELNET), Point-to-Point (PPP).</p>

                <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Is used to transfer hyper texts over the internet and defines how the information needs to be formatted and transmitted. It will also tell the web browser the action it needs to perform in regards with the users input.</li>
                <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): This is just an extension of HTTP but it is used for secure communication over the internet by encrypting the information.</li>
                <li>Internet Protocol (IP): Is used with TCP and is designed as an addressing protocol to route nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system.</li>
                <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Is used to communicate over a network like sending a message. The message is divided into packets after it has been sent by the user and reassembled once it reaches the destination.</li>
                <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP): Is a protocol used other than TCP for communication. It is less reliable than TCP but works faster so it is used in time sensitive applications.</li>
                <li>Post office Protocol (POP): Is used in emails where it helps us to retrieve emails from the receiver mail server.</li>
                <li>Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP): We use this protocol to sent emails to the desired email id.</li>
                <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP): This protocol helps use to move files from one device to another device.</li>
                <li>Terminal Network (TELNET): This protocol enables us to connect one computer with another computer. Then when every we display something on the remote computer will display on the local computer.</li>
                <li>Point-to-Point (PPP): We use this protocol to enable a link between to two communicating devices. This will allow the two devices to exchange information with each other. </li>
